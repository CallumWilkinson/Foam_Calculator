This is a calculator I made for my job at Clark Rubber to calculate the cost of foam for customers. The user enters in a colour, thickness, length, width and number of cushions and the calcualtor looks up a csv file, finds the unit price and SKU code, and calculates the total price. Before I made this calculator me and my team at work would manually calculate each quote for customers on paper, which often lead to errors and people loosing the papers that the quotes were written on. This calculator reduced errors and made the quoting process much faster and simpler for both myself and my team at work.

The main motivation to make this project was that I would often get customers ask me to write a quote for multiple pieces of foam in one thickness and then say "Oh, thats too expensive, what if I got it in a different type of foam how much would that be?" I would then have to spend 10 minutes writing out the entire quote again just to make one change. This calculator solved that problem as now my team can quickly perform a "What if analysis" for customers and give them multiple quotes, which increased sales and halved the time we spent quoting customers. It also made the process of teaching new hires the quoting process much easier and reduced errors made by new trainees.
