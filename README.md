This is a calculator I made for my job at Clark Rubber to calculate the cost of foam for customers. The user enters in a colour, thickness, length, width and number of cushions and the calcualtor looks up a csv file, finds the unit price and SKU code, and calculates the total price. Before I made this calculator me and my team at work would manually calculate each quote for customers on paper, which often lead to errors and people loosing the papers that the quotes were written on. This calculator reduced errors and made the quoting process much faster and simpler for both myself and my team at work.
